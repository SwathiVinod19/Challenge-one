```

###About my role

The code for this project was already provided by UoT Bootcamp. 

I made changes to the codebase in order to optimize the company website for better performance in search engines. The changes made are in line with the accessibility standards as taught by UoT bootcamp.


``` 

I made changes in the following areas:


I added semantic HTML elements
I ensured that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
I added alt attributes to pictures and icons
I ensured that the heading attributes fall in sequential order in general
I changed the title of the website to optimize its performance in search engine

```
